- AI lawyers help with paperwork.
- Even your fridge uses AI to reorder milk.

But don’t worry, humans still write poems. ❤️

## 🛰️ Mars Base Beta is Operational

We now have 28 people living on Mars.

| Crew Type     | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| Scientists    | 18    |
| Engineers     | 6     |
| Artists       | 4     |

Art on Mars? Yes. Because we still need meaning.

## 💡 What We Miss from 2025

- Street food.
- Old memes.
- Long walks without AR glasses.

Take care of your time. It’s more powerful than you think.

With love,  
**Someone from the Future**
